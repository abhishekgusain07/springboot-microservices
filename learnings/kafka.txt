Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform designed to handle high volumes of data in real-time. Think of it as a super-powered message queue system that can reliably move data between different parts of your system.
Here are the core concepts of Kafka:

Event Streaming Architecture:


Producers publish messages/events to topics
Topics store streams of events in a fault-tolerant, durable way
Consumers subscribe to topics and process the events


Main Use Cases:


Real-time data pipelines
Microservices communication
Activity tracking/monitoring
Log aggregation
Stream processing
Event-driven architectures

The Kafka producer configuration:
yamlCopy  kafka:
    producer:
      bootstrap-servers: localhost:9092  # Kafka broker address
This specifies the Kafka broker location where your service will connect.
The serialization settings:
yamlCopy      key-serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
      value-serializer: org.springframework.kafka.support.serializer.JsonSerializer

key-serializer: Uses String serialization for message keys
value-serializer: Uses JSON serialization for message values, allowing you to send Java objects as messages

The type mapping:
yamlCopy      properties:
        spring.json.type.mapping: orderConfirmation:com.gusain.ecommerce.kafka.OrderConfirmation
This creates an alias mapping where:

orderConfirmation is the alias/type identifier
com.gusain.ecommerce.kafka.OrderConfirmation is the actual Java class

This mapping is crucial for deserialization on the consumer side, helping Kafka know how to convert JSON messages back into Java objects. When sending messages, your OrderConfirmation class objects will be automatically serialized to JSON and can be properly deserialized by consumers that know about this type mapping.
Would you like to see an example of how to use this configuration with actual code?
